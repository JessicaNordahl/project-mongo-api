# Mongo API Project

The goal with this project was to learn how to store data, model data, fetch items from Mongo database and return error messages from Mongo database, using Mongoose.  

## The challenge

Deployed to Heroku for the first time. 
Project is built in Node.js with Express

There were many problems/errors when trying to deploy the project, but after many changes I finally got it to work.
